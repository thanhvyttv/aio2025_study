conclusion can be drawn from the observed grb redshift distribution we study and compare three well defined samples of long grbs detected by swift hete and bepposax we find that swift grbs are slighly fainter and harder than bepposax and hete grbs as expected due to the higher energy range in which swift grbs are detected and localized compared to bepposax and hete gas and dust obscuration plays a role in shaping the grb samples and the present samples of grbs with redshift we argue that the majority of the bright swift grbs without redshift might actually be z events therefore the present swift grb sample with redshift is biased against lowz grbs on the other hand the detection of bright uv restframe afterglows from highz grbs and even from those with large xray obscuration implies a dust amount lower than in nearby grbsandor a different dust composition if this is the case the swift sample of grbs with redshifts is probably a fair sample of the real highz grb population the absence of highz grbs in the bepposax and hete samples of grbs with redshifts is probably due to the fact at the time of bepposax and hete followup faint afterglows of high redshift grbs will have weaken below the spectroscopic capabilities of even m class telescopes the redshift distribution of a subsample of swift grbs with distributions of peakfluxes xray obscuration and optical magnitude at
