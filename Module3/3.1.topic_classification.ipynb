to create unique lifts of finite dimensional invariant subspaces of one term of the sequence to invariant subspaces of the preceding term this allows us to take invariant cohomological classes and under the right circumstances construct unique currents of a given type including unique measures of a given type that represent those classes and are invariant under pullback a dynamically interesting self map may have a plethora of invariant measures so the uniquess of the constructed currents is important it means that if local growth is not too big compared to the growth rate of the cohomological class then the expanding cohomological class gives sufficient marching orders to the system to prohibit the formation of any other such invariant current of the same type say from some

capable of creating strong civ and ovi lines out to about twice that distance we also analyze the mean transmissivity of hi civ and ovi within h mpc from starforming galaxies the probability

metal enrichment up to very high redshifts the present grb samples with redshift determination are largely incomplete and therefore a careful analysis of selection effects is mandatory before any conclusion can be drawn from the observed grb redshift distribution we study and compare three well defined samples of long grbs detected by swift hete and bepposax we find that swift grbs are slighly fainter and harder than bepposax and hete grbs as expected due to the higher energy range in which swift grbs are detected and localized compared to bepposax and hete gas and dust obscuration plays a role in shaping the grb samples and the present samples of grbs with redshift we argue that the majority of the bright swift grbs without redshift might actually be z events therefore the present swift grb sample with redshift is biased against lowz grbs on the other hand the detection of bright uv restframe afterglows from highz grbs and even from those with large xray obscuration implies a dust amount lower than in nearby grbsandor a different dust composition if this is the case the swift sample of grbs with redshifts is probably a fair sample of the real highz grb population the absence of highz grbs in the bepposax and hete samples of grbs with redshifts is probably due to the fact at the time of bepposax and hete followup faint afterglows of high redshift grbs will have weaken below the spectroscopic capabilities of even m class telescopes the redshift distribution of a subsample of swift grbs with distributions of peakfluxes xray obscuration and optical magnitude at
